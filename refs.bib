@article{Abdol_2021,
	abstract = {{Meta-researchers increasingly study biases in quantitative study outcomes (effect sizes) that emerge from questionable research practices (QRPs) in designing, running, analyzing, and reporting studies. Here, we introduce an extensible and modular C++ simulation framework called \href{https://sam.amirmasoudabdol.name/}{SAM} (Science Abstract Model) that enables systematic study of the effects of QRPs and researchers’ degrees of freedom (\emph{p}-hacking) on a host of outcomes across the different phases of quantitative studies that test hypotheses. SAM achieves this by modular modeling of different entities and processes involved in research, from study designs and inferential criteria, the data collection and analyses, to the submission and acceptance of manuscripts in a journal. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach by reproducing and extending the Bakker, van Dijk, and Wicherts (2012) simulation study that investigated the effects of various \emph{p}-hacking methods and publication bias on meta-analytic outcomes. We showcase how SAM’s modularity and flexibility makes it possible to easily examine the original study by modifying, adding, or removing different components— e.g., publication bias, different significance levels, or meta-analytic metrics. We focus our illustration on the fundamental question of whether lowering $\alpha$ will reduce the biases in the scientific literature.}},

@article{Friese_2020aa,
	abstract = {Science depends on trustworthy evidence. Thus, a biased scientific record is of questionable value because it impedes scientific progress, and the public receives advice on the basis of unreliable evidence that has the potential to have far-reaching detrimental consequences. Meta-analysis is a technique that can be used to summarize research evidence. However, meta-analytic effect size estimates may themselves be biased, threatening the validity and usefulness of meta-analyses to promote scientific progress. Here, we offer a large-scale simulation study to elucidate how p-hacking and publication bias distort meta-analytic effect size estimates under a broad array of circumstances that reflect the reality that exists across a variety of research areas. The results revealed that, first, very high levels of publication bias can severely distort the cumulative evidence. Second, p-hacking and publication bias interact: At relatively high and low levels of publication bias, p-hacking does comparatively little harm, but at medium levels of publication bias, p-hacking can considerably contribute to bias, especially when the true effects are very small or are approaching zero. Third, p-hacking can severely increase the rate of false positives. A key implication is that, in addition to preventing p-hacking, policies in research institutions, funding agencies, and scientific journals need to make the prevention of publication bias a top priority to ensure a trustworthy base of evidence.

@article{John_2012aa,
	abstract = {Cases of clear scientific misconduct have received significant media attention recently, but less flagrantly questionable research practices may be more prevalent and, ultimately, more damaging to the academic enterprise. Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

@article{Duval_2000,
	abstract = {Summary. We study recently developed nonparametric methods for estimating the number of missing studies that might exist in a meta-analysis and the effect that these studies might have had on its outcome. These are simple rank-based data augmentation techniques, which formalize the use of funnel plots. We show that they provide effective and relatively powerful tests for evaluating the existence of such publication bias. After adjusting for missing studies, we find that the point estimate of the overall effect size is approximately correct and coverage of the effect size confidence intervals is substantially improved, in many cases recovering the nominal confidence levels entirely. We illustrate the trim and fill method on existing meta-analyses of studies in clinical trials and psychometrics.},

@article{Begg_1994,
	abstract = {An adjusted rank correlation test is proposed as a technique for identifying publication bias in a meta-analysis, and its operating characteristics are evaluated via simulations. The test statistic is a direct statistical analogue of the popular "funnel-graph." The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant. The proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool for meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement the funnel-graph.},
