# Decision Strategies

> *Decision Strategy executes researcher's logic behind starting and
> stopping the questionable research practices.*

Decision strategy acts as the brain of the researcher. Their specifications will be used by the Researcher to perform two main tasks, Selection and Decision. As discussed in [Design](design.md#decision-strategy), in most cases a Selection follows by a Decision. We will refer to this process as **Selection â†’ Decision** sequence. 

As researcher needs to perform several selections and decisions during her course of research, each selection and decision are defined separately in the configuration file. All possible selections and decisions steps can be found in the list below:

- Initial **Selection Policy**
- Will be Hacking **Decision Policy**
  - Each hacking strategy will end with a selection-decision of its own, read more on [Hacking Stage](research-workflow.md#hacking-stage)
    - Selection
    - Decision
    - ...
- Between Hacked Outcomes **Selection Policies**
- Will Continue Replicating **Decision Policies**
- Will be Submitting To Journal **Decision Policy**

Figure 1 shows a simplified version of research workflow only highlighing **Selection** and **Decision** stages.
