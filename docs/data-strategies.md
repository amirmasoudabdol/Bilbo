# Data Strategies

*Data Strategy is the source of data, i.e., population. It knows the underlying design, and its properties*. During [research preperation](flow.md#prepare-research), Researcher reaches to Data Strategy object and uses it to populates — ie., generates/collects data for — its Experiment.

## Study Design

Parameters of Data Strategy are intertwined with experiment design parameters. Before defining the model, we need to specify the structure of our design, number of observations in each group, and [number of replications](/decision-strategies.md#post-qrp-decision-and-replication-stage) if applicable. Study design is being detemrined by setting the number of treatment conditions, *n* (`n_conditions`) and the number of dependent variables in each condition, *d* (`n_dep_vars`). After specifying our design, each group is being populated by `n_obs` observations based on the given model, specified in `data_strategy`. 

```json hl_lines="3 4 5 6"
{
    "experiment_parameters": {
        "n_reps": 5,
        "n_conditions": 2,
        "n_dep_vars": 1,
        "n_obs": 25,
        "data_strategy": {
            "name": "",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

We can configure the type and specifications of the model using `data_strategy` parameter. In the rest of this section, we will discuss two available options [Linear Model](/data-strategies.md#linear-model) and [Graded Response Model](/data-strategies.md#graded-response-model), and their available range of options.

<!--
| **Parameters** | **Value** / **Type** |
|:---------------|:---------------------|
| `n_conditions` | n<sub>c</sub>, `int` |
| `n_dep_vars`   | n<sub>d</sub>, `int` |
| `n_obs`        | n<sub>o</sub>, `int` |
| `n_reps`       | n<sub>r</sub>, `int` |
-->

<!-- Since Data Strategy is aware of all the underlying models, parameters and distributions, it is capale of providing data at any points during the simulation.  -->

<!-- As mentioned, methods like [optional stopping](/hacking-strategies.md#hacking-strategies-optional-stopping) needs to add new data points to the already existing measurements. Requiring data strategies to produce *new* data points helps with implementation of such hacking strategies. -->

## Linear Model

In the case of Linear Model, SAM models $\bar{y} = \bar{x} + \bar{\epsilon}$ where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{\epsilon} are  vectors of values drawn either from a single multivariate distribution, or a set of univariate distributions. Two following configurations showcase variants of this setup. As it is shown, it is possible to mix and match uni- and multi-variate distributions.

SAM supports a wide range of statistical [distributions](/distributions.md). While most distirbutions accept a set of predefined parameters, multivariate normal distribution offers some helper parameters for easier configuration, Table 1. While it is possible to fully configure mean, *μ*, and the convriance matrix, *Σ*; we are able to set fixed values for covariance and standard deviations and guide SAM to generate an appropriate covariance matrix.

| **Parameters** | **Value** / **Type**                 |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `means`        | *μ*, `double` or `array`             |
| `stddevs`      | *σ<sup>2</sup>*, `double` or `array` |
| `covs`         | *σ<sub>x y</sub>*, `double`          |
| `sigma`        | *Σ*, `matrix`                        |

    }

!!! warning
    It's important to keep in mind that the given distribution should be able to account for the pre-defined study design; otherwise, SAM cannot initialize the Experiment and an error will occur.



## Graded Response Model

The current implementation of the Graded Response Model is based on the generalization of [Rasch Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasch_model). The probablity of person $j$ answering an item $i$ correctly, $Pr(X_{ij} = 1)$, can be calculated based on the difficulty $\beta$ of the item $i$ and the ability $\theta$ of a person $j$ with the following model[@Bakker_2014]:

$$ Pr(X_{ij} = 1) = \frac{exp(\theta_j - \beta_i)}{1 + exp(\theta_j - \beta_i)} $$

Besides [general design parameters](/data-strategies.md#study-design), we need to provide *number of categories*, as well as *number of items* per category to be able to completely setup a GRM. Thereafter, we need to configure distributions of *abilities* and *difficulties*. Similar to the linear model, these parameters can be set 

| **Parameters** | **Value** / **Type**     |
|:---------------|:-------------------------|
| `n_categories` | `int`                    |
| `n_items`      | `int`                    |
| `abilities`    | *θ*, `double` or `array` |
| `difficulties` | *β*, `double` or `array` |

After calculating all responses of person $j$ to all items, the sum
score of all answers is calcuated for each person by adding all the item
scores \[from, Marjan 2014\].

!!! info 
    Since SAM is mainly a C++ library, it supports all available statistical distributions available in [STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random). For multivariate distributions, SAM uses available distributions in [baaraan](/baaraan.md) library.
