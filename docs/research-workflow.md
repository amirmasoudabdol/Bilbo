# Research Workflow

After [introducing](flow.md) the general execution flow, and clarifying how the general research workflow is implemented, in this section, we will get into the details of Decision Strategy and Research Workflow.

## Decision Strategy

Decision making is one of the main processes of conducting a research. A researcher 



Figure 1 shows the overview of how a `Researcher` conducts her research step by step. This process can be separated into two main processes, *Main Research Workflow* and *Hacking Workflow*. As discussed in the [Introduction](introduction.me), a research starts by initializing the Experiment Setup and thereafter preparing the Experiment (i.e., generating data, calculating statistics, running tests, etc.). 

At this point during the research process, researcher has the entire Experiment at hand and can asses her hypothesis.
