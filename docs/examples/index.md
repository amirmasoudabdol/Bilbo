# Designing Your Own Simulation

In this section, we describe the process of reproducing several published simulation studies using SAM. 

We have tried to reproduce every study as close as possible, and rigorously use them as our extended testing and benchmarking steps. Each example explains in detail how to translate different aspects of a simulation study, eg., data strategy, research workflow, etc., into SAM's configurations. We have selected a wide range of simulations and configurations to showcase the extend of SAM's flexibility and reach.
