# Experimental Studies

In this section, we present a few experimental studies each targeting different aspect of process of conducting a research. We start by study the effect of [Selective Reporting](/hacking-strategies/selective-reporting.md) on probability of finding significant results, followed by an experiment to showcase the effect of sample size variation. 

As we progress to make our design more complicated, we incorporate what we have observed from previous studies.
