# Experimental Studies

In this section, we present a few experimental studies, each targeting different aspects of conducting a research. We start by studying effects of [Selective Reporting](/hacking-strategies/selective-reporting.md) on probability of finding significant results, followed by an experiment showcasing effects of sample size variation on known research quality and meta-analysis metrics.

As we progress to make our design more complicated, we incorporate what we have observed from previous studies.
