# SAM

SAM is an extensible and modular framework for simulating and studying effects of various questionable research practices, QRPs, on scientific results. It provides interfaces and APIs for designing, and experimenting on several statistical models under the influence of various *p*-hacking strategies as well as other types of QRPs. For instance, the user is able to design a simulation to could design a two-by-two factorial experiment and study the effect of optional stopping on achieving significant results. SAM offers analysis of a number of conventional and recognized *p*-hacking methods out of the box; additionally, the user will be able to implement new methods based on her preferences.

In this vignette, we will describe the underlying design principles and main features of SAM alongside some examples. In the [Design](design.md) section, we describe types of problems that SAM analyses. After setting the ground rules, we describes different components of SAM and the process of designing your own simulation.
